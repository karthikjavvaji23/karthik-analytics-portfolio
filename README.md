👋 Welcome To My Data Analyst Portfolio — Karthik Javvaji

I’m truly excited about the world of data—how numbers, patterns, and behaviors can be transformed into insights that drive real business decisions. For me, data analytics isn’t just about dashboards or models; it’s about solving real problems, understanding why trends happen, predicting what comes next, and helping organizations make smarter, faster, and more confident decisions.

This portfolio is a collection of the projects I’m most proud of—built using Power BI, Python, Prophet ML, DAX, ETL, data modeling, and end-to-end analytical storytelling. Whether it’s forecasting sales, segmenting customers, or optimizing inventory, I love bringing data to life in a way that delivers clear business value.
