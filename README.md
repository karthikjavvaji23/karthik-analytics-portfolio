# 🌟 **Welcome To My Data Analyst Portfolio — Karthik Javvaji**

I’m passionate about transforming raw data into insights that solve real business problems. Data analytics excites me because it blends logic, creativity, and impact—turning trends into stories, predictions into strategy, and numbers into decisions.

This portfolio showcases the projects I’ve built across **Power BI, Python, Machine Learning, ETL pipelines, forecasting, and BI storytelling**. Whether it’s predicting sales, identifying at-risk customers, or analyzing financial performance, I enjoy bringing data to life in ways that deliver measurable value.
